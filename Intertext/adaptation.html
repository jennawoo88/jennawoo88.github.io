<div class="description">Pi’s used several different survival skills to help him survive.  He thought carefully and used adaptation.  He learned how to adapt to his current situation quickly.  This enabled him to take stock of himself, not to act rash, but rather think things through in order to survive.  Pi accepted the fact that he was stranded with animals, after a couple of hours of being shipwrecked.  He thought calmly of his situation and began creating a plan of action.</div>
<div class="description2"><a href="Chapter%2059.html">“It took me a good part of the day to fix up the raft. There were so many details to look after. The constant motion of the sea, though gentle, didn't make my work any easier.” Chapter (59)</a></div>
<div class="description3">Pi took an inventory of the supplies that were on lifeboat.  He started to make a plan as to how he would keep Richard Parker fed, and what Pi would do after he ran out of his supplies.  For example, Pi knows he is going to run out of his supply of fresh water, so he used his ingenuity and created a device with the things that were present on the boat to help him gather water.  When it rained  he had his rain catcher out with a plastic bag to help him store his water,</div>
<div class="description4"><a href="Chapter%2053.html">“By the time I had opened the rain catcher above my head and tucked my feet into the plastic bag, I was already soaked to the bones. And the blanket had got wet when I fell back onto the raft. I wrapped myself with it nonetheless.” (Chapter 53)</a></div>
<div class="description5"> He also had his solar stills out on the ocean, purifying the ocean water he had collected to create clean drinking water.  Pi tried to be prepared for as much as he could possible be prepared for so that Richard Parker and himself wouldn’t run out of food and water, so they would survive until they floated towards land.</div>

	<div class="text">Overall, Pi’s will to survive is driven by what could also potential end his life, which is the tiger. Pi had to think about what he was up against and try his best to adapt to the situation he was in. With the tiger’s presence, it was a constant reminder of his will to survive. He was not only fighting for his own survival, but also for his now friend, the tiger, Richard Parker. Richard Parker served not only as his companion during their time together out at sea, but also gave him purpose, hope and peace that they would survive together.</div>

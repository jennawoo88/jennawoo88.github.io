	<div class="text">When faced with challenges in life, what will you do? How will you react? Will you rise to the occasion and work your way through it? What survival skills will you use? Ordinarily, you don’t think about how you get through each day. It’s only when you’re faced with some kind of struggle or something happens that’s not within the norm that you worry about how you will make it through the day. It’s because of these struggles that causes you to think and debate about the best way to proceed. When confronted with uncertainty, one of the hardest things to do is to find the courage and strength to rise to the occasion; to face it head on. At times you may falter, but what’s important is that you keep trying and fighting, to adapt to the situation at hand to do the best that you can to push through and try to move forward, to hope that each day will be better than the day before, and to stay positive even though the situation may seem bleak, it’s all in an attempt to survive.</div>

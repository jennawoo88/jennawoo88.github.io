	<div class="text">Another survival skill that Pi has is hope to life another day and his positivity . When you have no one else but a tiger to keep you company through those long days lost in the ocean, what would you think? Pi talked to Richard Parker as if he was a human being, his friend, and comrade stuck with him in the middle of nowhere in the ocean. Literally, they were in the same boat. He forgot that Richard Parker was a wild animal, a tiger that could potentially kill him, and eat him. Pi was grateful that Richard Parker was with him during this journey. He says in the book,  <mark><a href="chapter57.html">“If I still had the will to live, it was thanks to Richard Parker. He kept me from thinking too much about my family and my tragic circumstances. He pushed me to go on living. I hated him for it, yet at the same time I was grateful. I am grateful. It's the plain truth: without Richard Parker, I wouldn't be alive today to tell you my story.” (Chapter 57)</a></mark>  Without the tiger giving him hope or the fear of being eaten by him, everyday, Pi would have given up trying to survive. The tiger gave him someone else to think about besides himself. <mark><a href="chapter57.html">“It was Richard Parker who calmed me down. It is the irony of this story that the one who scared me witless to start with was the very same who brought me peace, purpose, I dare say even wholeness.” (Chapter 57)</a></mark>  Richard Parker is Pi’s hope to finding land because Pi had hope he fought to survive. <mark><a href="chapter51.html">“I looked down between my legs. I thought I would faint for joy. The open locker glistened with shiny new things. Oh, the delight of the manufactured good, the man-made device, the created thing! That moment of material revelation brought an intensity of pleasure-a heady mix of hope, surprise, disbelief, thrill, gratitude, all crushed into one-unequalled in my life by any Christmas, birthday, wedding, Diwali or other gift-giving occasion. I was positively giddy with happiness.” (Chapter 51).</a></mark></div>

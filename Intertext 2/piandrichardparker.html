	<div class="text">In the book, Life of Pi, by Yann Martel we are introduced to Piscine Molitor Patel, <mark><a href="chapter3.html">"I was named after a swimming pool. Quite peculiar considering my parents never took to water..." (Chapter 3)</a></mark> otherwise known as Pi, the main character in the book. We are given the opportunity to view different time frames of Pi’s life, learning about him. All of these different stories lead us to Pi growing up, and facing the most difficult time in his life, which is his struggle to survive lost at sea. His ability to survive against all odds is the main theme of the book. He was faced with many different challenges when the ocean liner crashed at sea. Pi was alone as he drifted in the ocean. The only companions, if you can call them that, were animals, but most of them didn’t last very long, except for the tiger, named Richard Parker, <mark><a href="chapter48.html">"Richard Parker was so named because of a clerical error..." (Chapter 48)</a></mark> which is the supporting character in the book. I see the tiger as the physical reminder as to how he intends to survive. Pi had to approach his survival with careful thought and ingenuity as to what he needed to do. He needed to adapt to his current situation and hope that he would not be eaten by the tiger. Pi needed to believe that he would survive as he was being tested stranded out in the vast sea.</div>
